A mobile app built with React Native and Expo that utilizes the 42 API to search for user logins and display detailed information including profile picture, skills, completed projects, and more.

## Steps:

1. [ ] **Setup Project:**
   - [ ] Initialize a new React Native project using Expo.
   - [ ] Set up a Git repository for version control.
   - [ ] Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys.

2. [ ] **Implement Views:**
   - [ ] Design and create at least two views: one for searching 42 logins and another for displaying user information.
   - [ ] Utilize React Navigation to navigate between views.

3. [ ] **Integrate 42 API:**
   - [ ] Configure Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests to the 42 API.
   - [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication for secure access to user data.

4. [ ] **Display User Information:**
   - [ ] Fetch user data based on the entered login from the 42 API.
   - [ ] Display profile picture, login, email, mobile, level, location, wallet, evaluations, skills with level and percentage, and completed projects.

5. [ ] **Implement Navigation:**
   - [ ] Allow users to navigate back to the search view from the user information view.

6. [ ] **Layout and Styling:**
   - [ ] Implement Auto Layout or constraint/modern layout for iOS9+ iPhones.
   - [ ] Enhance the design with custom cells, scroll views, and other UI enhancements.

7. [ ] **Bonus Features:**
   - [ ] Consider implementing bonus features such as recreating tokens at expiration, improving design aesthetics, incorporating custom cells, or adding additional functionality to enhance the user experience.

8. [ ] **Testing and Debugging:**
   - [ ] Test the app thoroughly to ensure functionality and responsiveness across various devices.
   - [ ] Debug any issues encountered during testing.

9. [ ] **Documentation and Presentation:**
   - [ ] Document the project, including installation instructions and any known issues.
   - [ ] Prepare a presentation highlighting the features, technologies used, and any challenges faced during development.

10. [ ] **Version Control and Deployment:**
    - [ ] Commit changes regularly to the Git repository.
    - [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.
    - [ ] Deploy the app to a test environment for evaluation and feedback.
